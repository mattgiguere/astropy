What's New in Astropy 0.4?
==========================

Overview

Documentation/Sphinx extension changes
--------------------------------------

Starting in v0.4, astropy documentation will now show the full name of functions
and classes prefixed by the intended user-facing location.  This is in contrast
to previous versions, which pointed to the actual implementation module, rather
than the intended public API location.

This will affect URLs pointing to specific documentation pages.  For example,
this URL points to the v0.3 location of the
`astropy.cosmology.luminosity_distance` function:
http://docs.astropy.org/en/v0.3/api/astropy.cosmology.funcs.luminosity_distance.html
while the appropriate URL for v0.4 and later is:
http://docs.astropy.org/en/v0.4/api/astropy.cosmology.luminosity_distance.html


Deprecation and backward-incompatible changes
---------------------------------------------

None.
